This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await error handling when dealing with network requests. The `fetchData` function uses async/await to fetch data from a URL. However, it may not handle all possible error scenarios comprehensively, potentially leading to unexpected crashes or silent failures. The solution provided addresses these shortcomings for more robust error handling.
